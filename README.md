# Go Fundamentals Course

Welcome to the **Go Fundamentals Course** repository by Bayt-al-Hikmah! This collection of lecture notes is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master Go (Golang) programming fundamentals. Whether you're new to coding or refreshing your skills, these notes provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core concepts.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in the Go language.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computers and file management.
    
- No prior programming experience required (though helpful).
    
- Go toolchain and an IDE like VS Code (with the Go extension) or GoLand.
    

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Go:
    
        - Download the Go toolchain from go.dev.
    
        - Alternatively, use an online tool like the Go Playground (play.golang.org).
    
2. Install an editor/IDE: VS Code with the official Go extension is recommended for beginners.
    
3. Test your setup: Run a "Hello, World!" program (example in Lecture 1).
    

## Course Overview

This 5-lecture series covers essential Go topics progressively. Each lecture includes:

- Theoretical explanations.
    
- Code examples and snippets.
    
- Exercises for practice.
    
- References for further reading.
    

|**Lecture**|**Topic**|**Key Concepts Covered**|
|---|---|---|
|Lecture 1|Go Basics and Computer Fundamentals|How computers work, intro to programming, Go syntax, variables, user I/O with `fmt` package.|
|Lecture 2|Data Structures and Control Flow|Strings, arrays, slices, maps, comparison/logical operators, `if/else`, `switch`, `for` loops.|
|Lecture 3|Functions, Packages, and Modules|Defining functions, return values, creating packages, managing dependencies with Go Modules.|
|Lecture 4|Pointers, Structs, Interfaces, and Error Handling|Pointers, `struct` types, methods, `interface` implementation, polymorphism, `iota`, `error` handling.|
|Lecture 5|Concurrency, File I/O, and CLI Tools|Goroutines, channels, file I/O (`os` package), command-line arguments (`flag` package).|

**Recommended Pace**: 1-2 lectures per week, with time for coding practice. Total estimated time: 15-25 hours.

## Practice and Projects

- Exercises: Each lecture ends with coding challenges. Solutions are added in a separate folder "Solution".
    
- Mini-Project Ideas:
    
        - Lecture 2: Command-line calculator using control flow (if/switch).
    
        - Lecture 4: A simple task manager using structs and interfaces.
    
        - Lecture 5: File-based note-taking app using file I/O and CLI flags.
    
- Resources: go.dev for documentation, pkg.go.dev for packages, and Exercism Go track for problems.
